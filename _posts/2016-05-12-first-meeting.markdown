# What is The Hacker Within

THW is a peer-led organization originally started at UW-Madison that seeks to
facilitate the sharing of skills and experience in using and writing scientific
software.

At IIASA, THW is comprised of any interested person who uses or develops code
and would find such a community useful.

# What do We Talk About

We're open to talking about anything and everything that a scientist who uses a
computer would find useful. This includes everything from tips on writing C code
to cool Excel tricks to writing and serving a blog. Especially early on, topics
will likely focus on workflow tools and software writing best practices such as

- using the command line
- version control
- automatic documentation
- testing

## Suggested Topics

These are the topics that were suggested for future meetings at this meeting:

- git & github
- gis with rasterio and fiona
- qgis/arcgis & python
- how to make a webapp
- d3 and other visualization tools
- database management and workflows
- how to make a mobile app
- java & gams
- gams
- R, ggplot, etc.
- integrating file grabbing and updating from external datasources

# What to Expect at a Meeting

Meetings are informal and very much share-share-alike. It is preferred to have
tutorial-like walk-throughs that attendees can follow along with, but it is not
a requirement.

Meetings are composed of

- approximately 30 minutes on a topic of interest for scientific computation
- additional time for questions
- additional time for lightning talks and/or open Q&A

## Lightning Talks

Lightning talks are short, impromptu talks that can cover any number of
interesting topics from "here's a cool command line utility I uncovered" to "I
found a cool new plotting library" to "I have this bug in my code that I can't
figure out and would love input on".

# How to Update the Website

Let's walk through the [README](https://github.com/thehackerwithin/iiasa) and
look at updating the website.
